From [Wikipedia](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cifra_de_C%C3%A9sar):
> In cryptography, the Caesar Cipher, also known as the switch cipher, Caesar code or Caesar switch, is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the text is derived by another, which appears in the alphabet below a fixed number of times. For example, with a three-position swap, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on.
> The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals.

There’s a video about it from [Harvard’s CS50 class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36xNpbosfTY).

Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string:
```ruby
caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
=> "Bmfy f xywnsl!"
```
